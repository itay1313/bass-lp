# 🎸 Bass Guitar Landing Page

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my absolutely rad bass guitar landing page. If you're wondering why I built this - well, who doesn't need a new bass guitar? 🤘

## 🚀 What's This All About?

This isn't just another landing page. It's a whole vibe:

- 🎨 Switches between light/dark mode like a boss
- 🌟 3D bass guitar that floats around (because gravity is overrated)
- 🎉 Throws a party (confetti!) when someone submits the form
- 📱 Looks sweet on any device (responsive AF)
- 🇮🇱 Handles Hebrew text like a pro (RTL support built-in)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Built with some pretty cool stuff:

```bash
Next.js + TypeScript + Three.js + Tailwind CSS = 🔥
```

Plus some extra goodies:

- 🎨 next-themes for that sweet dark mode
- 🎸 @react-three/fiber & drei for the floating bass
- 🎉 canvas-confetti because why not?
- 📊 Airtable for form submissions (keeping it organized)

```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]

2. Install the goods:
